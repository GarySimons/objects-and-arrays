    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //let age = 100;
    //let age2 = age;
    //console.log(age, age2);
    //age = 200;
    //console.log(age, age2);

    //let name = 'Wes';
    //let name2 = name;
    //console.log(name, name2);
    //name = "Wesley";
    //console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team); 
    console.log(players); // these now both have added Lux to end of list because team[3] references bacl to original players variable. This is a REFERENCE


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() // when you slice with () blank, it makes a copy of that array.
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // this concatenates, and does the same thing

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // this ES6 method uses spread ... to get the array contents

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
